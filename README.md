# Flatiron Module 1 Data Science Project
 
## Overview

This project is the first solo Data Science project assigned for Flatiron School's self-paced Data Science program.  [Flatiron](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/data-science-bootcamp/online) is a professional program with specialties in Data Science, Software Engineering, and more.

## Background

This is the culmination of Module 1.  It is a fictitious scenario involving a client, Microsoft, investigating feasibility of founding a movie studio.

## Project Specifics

The project began with several zipped files of movie-related data.  The goal was to clean and analyze the data to develop business-relevant observations and suggestions.


## The Problem

### Should Microsoft enter the market of creating movies?
 
#### Metrics:  
>1) Return on investment - How much revenue was created divided by how much budget was allocated, minus 1. This was based primarily on IMDB data sources.
>2) Critical rating - How well received was a film by critics/the public.  Sources include IMDB average rating and Rotten Tomatoes freshness rating.

#### Questions:
 
>1) How is overall movie gross product trending compared to the economy?
>2) Are films’ critical rating and ROI correlated?
>3) Do high or low-budget films tend toward better roi/rating?
>4) Do films of certain genres tend toward better roi/rating?
>5) Do films with certain ratings (g-pg-r) tend toward better roi/rating
>6) What is the current market share of current studios & what are their roi/Critical ratings?

#### Results:
>1) Movie industry revenue is growing though not outpacing inflation.  This could indicate an opening.  COVID-19 was a huge shock to the system, shuttering theaters but giving a surge to home-viewing, a shift that could be an opportunity, but also a field with a great deal of uncertainty.  Proceed but with an eye on innovation to meet new patterns of viewer behavior.

>2) Critical Reception and Return-On-Investment are not well correlated.  Having both metrics as goals is desirable, but performing well in one does not automatically lead to the other.
>3) Higher budgets do tend to produce films with better critical reception; higher budgets do produce higher gross revenue (though not necessarily higher ROI).  Avoid making low-budget films to build up a quality reputation
>4) Choose film genres carefully – some are stable, some are high-risk high-reward.  Sci-fi films generally do well in both.  Avoid horror due to its low critical rating.
>5) G-Rated films tend to achieve good critical reviews – though this may be driven by BV/Disney, and may be difficult to duplicate. Avoid PG-13 films.
>6) BV(Disney), P/DW(Paramount), WB(NL)(Warner Brothers-New Line), Uni(Universal) are studios to emulate based on their ROI/Rating performance.
